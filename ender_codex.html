          <p>"This feeling, like I am beeing watched." The End is full of dangerous creatures. Watchlings might seem like regular brutes, but they are really strong and they are able to teleport. They can be stunned by large ammount of damage. The essence they drop is a tasty and regenerating treat.</p>

        <div class="textimgblock">
          <p>Void Cubes are powerfull foes and you should never underestimate them. They may seem slow, but DO NOT let them bite you, it will hurt... a lot. They also can change flow of gravity in nearbye creatures, pulling them up and then inverting gravity back to smash them on the ground. They drop void roe, but more on that later.</p>

          <p>Snarelings are a lot smarter than Watchlings, although they can be stunned too. When attacking they shoot sticky yellow liquid. They try to escape by teleporting once hurt, although they cannot once they are low on hp. They drop a blob of their yellow liquid which is a great as a fuel and excellent as light source.</p>

        <div class="textimgblock">
          <p>Endmetal is a new powerfull material you can make gear out of (tools included). Simply combine void roe and seed from novis orchis (large green flowers). Endmetal draws the energy of the dimension to deal more damage to its inhabitants. You will also get greater defense against any endermen related entities.</p>
