	As a substitute leader,
	I was tasked with multiple things
	delta force should do while
	out leader is gone.
	Creating new outposts,
	improving local lifestyle
	and researching that creep
	named Spamton.
	That guy is shadier than shadow.
	However, I can't find any new information
	about him, he started offering these weird jobs
	and then left to catch us near the Lightningvile.
	Ever since, no one has seen him. It's so quiet...
	too quiet.


	In these hard times, one needs
	to ease themselves through their hardships.
	Although we did not recieved a warm welcome,
	I still believe we might get along really well.
	Celebrate your winter's feast, but soon our time
	comes to shine.
